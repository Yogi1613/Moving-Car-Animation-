# Moving-Car-Animation-
In computer graphics we use graphic.h which provide diirect functions to draw different coordinate shapes (like, circles, rectangles etc.). By using these functions, we can draw different objects like car, hut, trees, etc. In this program, we will draw a moving car using line and circles.
Main aim of this Mini Project is to illustrate 2D Car Animation using OpenGl Computer Graphics. The concepts of OpenGl glut library and C++ has been used to create 2D Car Animation.
